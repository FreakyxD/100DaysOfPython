# 100 Days of Code Challenge

This is a repository where I publish the code I write for the [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on Udemy. The course is designed to help beginners learn Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. Each project covers a different topic or application of Python, such as data analysis, web development, game development, and more.

## How to use this repository

You can use this repository to follow along with my progress, see the solutions I came up with, or get inspired for your own projects.

To run the code in this repository, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. You may also need to install some additional libraries or modules depending on the project.

## Table of Contents [Under construction]

I'm aiming to showcase the more interesting projects here. Projects are organized into days (like the course structure).

## Feedback and Suggestions

I welcome any feedback or suggestions on how to improve my code. Thank you for visiting my repository and happy coding!
